# TRAPOD
This repository holds trained ML models that predict postoperative delirium (POD) measured in the recovery room. The best performing model comprises a tailored transformer architechtiure that we named TRAPOD. Please finf the stored models as .pt files under /models, implemented baseline models that can also be used out of the box are available under /baselines. Specifications for features, inputs, and conversions are linked under /metadata, we resampled our intraoperative time series with a three minutes sampling interval. Generally, TRAPOD inputs a matrix M_test as 238 (#features) x 10 (# time steps = first 30 minutes of surgery) x X (#surgeries as batch). Please load models as model = torch.load("./models/"MODEL_NAME.pt") and then predicting y_pred = model(M_test).
